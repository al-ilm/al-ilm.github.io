Data collection and statistical inference are processes we often do in scientific research,
and by inference we mean generalization of the sample estimates to the population. For example, if I want to estimate the 
number of hours spent by the teenagers on their smartphone in my community, the first thing I need to do is to take <i>n</i> random samples of these teenagers in the population,
monitor the number of hours they spent, and then take the average of it. The average, say 5 hrs/day, in this case is our estimate for the population
parameter which is the average hours spent. This type of sample estimate is called <b>point estimate</b>.
<p>
    While the point estimate above gives us some understanding of the average number of hours spent by the teenagers in the population, we can further extract 
    insights by doing some <b>statistical test</b>. Suppose we extend the above problem and accommodate the idea that the 5 hrs/day is the average number of hours spent
    by the teenagers on their smartphone five years ago. The question is, is 5 hrs/day still holds today? That is, we want to test our assumption or in this case our null
    hypothesis that
    <div class="question">    
        The number of hours spent by the teenagers is still 5 hrs/day,
    </div>    
</p>
<p>
    against the alternative hypothesis that,
    <div class="question">    
        The number of hours spent by the teenagers is more than 5 hrs/day.
    </div>    
</p>
<p>
    In order to answer this question, the obvious solution is to go out and take <i>n</i> random samples of teenagers and compute the average hours they spent on their 
    smartphones. Suppose this time we observed the average hours to be 8 hrs/day, is this enough for us to say that there is a change already in the 
    number of hours spent by the teenagers? You might say, Yes, because it is different already from 5 hrs/day; but no, since we are basing this from our
    random sample, and 5 hrs/day might still holds but we only obtain this difference because of the sampling error. If we were to repeatedly do the resampling,
    and take the average hours, we might still converge to mean average hours of 5 hrs/day in our sampling distribution if the null hypothesis is true. So the question is, how likely or unlikely is 
    our sample assuming the null hypothesis is true. This concept of statistical test is specifically known as <b>Hypothesis</b> or <b>Significance</b> testing.
